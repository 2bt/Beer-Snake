Beer Snake
==========

This little game was coded within 2.5 hours during a programming contest sponsored by 3m5., which contest took place at the Output 2011 TU-Dresden.

Since then, I decided to reimplement the same game in Lua using the [l√∂ve framework](http://love2d.org/).

The original programme needs `python-pygame` and `python-opengl` to run.
